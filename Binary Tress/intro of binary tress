 Binary Trees introduce a hierarchical arrangement taking a step ahead of the linear structure we have studied so far.

Binary Trees comprise of nodes, each capable of hosting at most two children hence the predecessor ‘Binary”. These structures mirror the hierarchical oraganisation seen in file systems.

Full Binary Trees impose the constraint that each node possesses either zero or two children, promoting a well-balanced structure and enhancing predictability in operations like traversal and insertion.

Complete Binary Trees, on the other hand, embrace a specialized form where all levels, save possibly the last, are completely filled. Their design, ensuring nodes are positioned leftmost on the last level, proves valuable for efficient data storage and access, resembling the organized arrangement of folders and files in a computer system.

Perfect Binary Trees take this hierarchical order a step further, showcasing a balanced structure where all leaf nodes align at the same level. Such trees optimize space by filling all levels with nodes, creating a dense structure.

Balanced Binary Trees ensure the difference in heights between subtrees of any node remains minimal, preventing significant skewing or imbalance.

Degenerate Trees represent a case where nodes arrange linearly, akin to a linked list, posing inefficiencies in search operations due to the lack of balance.
